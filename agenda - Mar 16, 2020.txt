Agenda/Notes - Mar 16, 2020


1) Schedules/Deadlines
	-When are people free?
		Artem - Mainly weekends/ Tues 7-9pm /Thurs 7-10pm EST majority of planning/coding/etc
		Alex - Flexible
		Calvin - Flexible		
		
	-How do we want/should split up the work in the project e.g. like the roles defined? 
		We will work collaboratively for now. Calvin will do some pre-planning ahead of meeting.
	
	-Proposed schedule:
		-Tues/Thurs 7-9pm EST majority of planning/coding/etc.
		-Thurs-Sat finish up uncompleted parts in the two day sessions
		-Sat midnight soft deadline for assigned tasks
		-Sun TBD a brief runthrough of entire project/segment
	

2) Project Idea
	
	-Idea: Game app prediction
		-Use app dataset on kaggle on the following links:
			-https://www.kaggle.com/kboghe/android-apps-metadata
			-https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps
			-https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games **we can use this for first segment to prototype
		-Use app data to predict rating of game based on various metrics
		-After first segment, we can look to do deeper analysis with other datasets
			-merge datasets from the other links
			-create new data tables
			-create relationships
			-store in sqlite

3) Requirements for Segment 1
	
	-GitHub setup
		-Create branches
			-data preprocessing
			-analysis
	-Preprocessing
		-select sample data from the app games csv
		-basic cleaning steps to ensure we can run machine learning
	-Machine Learning
		-choose machine learning e.g. regression analysis, to return value for our research question

4) Brainstorming - TBC 3/18/2021

	-Observations on given data
	-What are we trying to predict?
	-Are we able to predict our question? If not, how else should we go about this?

5) Pseudo Coding - TBC 3/18/2021

	-Map out the coding required to complete our segment

6) Coding - TBC 3/18/2021

	-Fill out code required to make the prototype

7) Questions for Dylan - TBC 3/18/2021

	-We are planning to work collaboratively for now, how do we show our work on GitHub to show we've equally contributed?
